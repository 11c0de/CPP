BINARY SEARCH WORKING:
1. Start with the middle element: Compare the key value with the middle element of the array.
2. Narrow down the search:
   If the key value is equal to the middle element, the search is complete.
   If the key value is less than the middle element, repeat the search on the left half of the array.
   If the key value is greater than the middle element, repeat the search on the right half of the array.
3. Repeat: Continue this process until the key value is found or the search interval is empty.

Time Complexity:
1.Best Case: O(1) - The key value is the middle element.
2.Worst Case: O(log n) - The key value is at one of the ends or not present.
3.Average Case: O(log n) - On average, the key value is somewhere in the middle.

When to Use Binary Search:
1.The list is sorted.
2.You need efficient search performance.
